denag
-----

   This is a Bourne shell script that wraps the compiler that ships with the
   MIPSpro development environment.  The wrapper scans the output from the
   compiler and suppresses the license nag screen.

How to install
--------------

   See INSTALL.

How to remove
-------------

   See REMOVE.

What it does
------------

   The denag script captures the output from the compiler and removes the
   license nag screen from stderr.  Both stdout and stderr are left alone
   and not combined (so you can still grep for errors and such).  Nothing
   special, the script is rather short.
