How to install 'denag'
----------------------

1.  Copy denag to /usr/local/bin

2.  Create a /usr/denag directory and populate it with these symlinks:

       CC -> /usr/lib/driverwrap
       c89 -> /usr/lib/driverwrap
       cc -> /usr/lib/driverwrap

3.  Create these symlinks in /usr/bin, replacing the ones that are there:

       CC -> /usr/local/bin/denag
       c89 -> /usr/local/bin/denag
       cc -> /usr/local/bin/denag

NOTES
-----

The MIPSpro development environment requires that the cc, c89, and CC
symlinks in a subdirectory beneath /usr.  It doesn't matter what you call
this directory, but it must be just one level under /usr.  I chose to call
it "denag".

If you change the name of this directory, please make the change in the
denag script itself, otherwise nothing will work.

You only need to make denag symlinks for the compiler.  The toolchain
commands (ld, as, etc.) work everyone, it's the compiler that requires the
license and has the nag screen.
